            <p>I've been working on robots since 2015. I have started his robotics journey with Arduino where I mostly advanced my knowledge about coding robots and using sensors. Later, I turned my interest to VEX EDR. I competed in many professional robotics competitions. In my junior year of high school, My robotics team and I competed at state level competitions that took place in San Fransisco. My role in the team was the designer and driver. Along the way to this success, his team and I had asses problems, do research, make decisions, build prototypes, test their methods, and continue to improve and refine their design, which improved my critical thinking and engineering skills. My robotics team was earned the best design award and ranked 127 out of 11,000 teams worldwide.</p>
